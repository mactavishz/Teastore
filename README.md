# TeaStore

This repository contains the refactored versions of an online store based on the [TeaStore](https://github.com/DescartesResearch/TeaStore) project.

Currently, there are different refactored versions of the TeaStore project being developed on different branches:

- [open-liberty](https://github.com/mactavishz/Teastore/tree/open-liberty): this branch contains the refactored system using Open Liberty, the frontend remains largely unchanged. 
- [frontend-remix](https://github.com/mactavishz/Teastore/tree/frontend-remix): this branch contains all the refactored system using Open Liberty and a new frontend using React and Remix. The frontend is completely rewritten and the backend is also refactored to use Open Liberty.
- [original](https://github.com/mactavishz/Teastore/tree/original): this branch contains the original system of the TeaStore project.

## Project Goals

We aim to refactor the original TeaStore project to improve its architecture and design and turn it into a more modern and maintainable system, so that we can use it as a testbed for our research on software architecture and design.

The main goals of the refactoring are:
- Improve the architecture and design of the system to make it more modular and maintainable.
- Try to use different technologies and frameworks to see how they affect the architecture and design of the system.
- Use the system as a testbed for benchmarking and evaluating different technologies and frameworks, and for research on software architecture and design.

## Getting Started

We only maintain the basic introductory information on the main branch. For more information on how to run the system, please refer to the README files in the respective branches.
